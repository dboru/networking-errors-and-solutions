Running shell scripts that have contain sudo commands in them from jenkins might not run as expected. To fix this, follow along
Simple steps:
1. On ubuntu based systems, run " $ sudo visudo "
2. this will open /etc/sudoers file.
3. If your jenkins user is already in that file, then modify to look like this:

jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
4. save the file by doing Ctrl+O  (dont save in tmp file. save in /etc/sudoers, confirm overwrite)
5. Exit by doing Ctrl+X
6. Relaunch your jenkins job 
7. you shouldnt see that error message again :)
